#PLAINIFIER

Plainifier attempts to translate any English sentence into Special English.
(Special English is a simplified version of English used for many things, but most notably
international news broadcasts.) In the process of translating, PLainifier
gathers information about how words are used together. Eventually it will also
take human feedback to ensure it does not make the same mistake twice.

Plainifier was originally trained using data from [the Brown
Corpus](https://archive.org/details/BrownCorpus).
